# MQB-FPA
This repository is about driving profiles customization for MQB platform cars (also known as FPA fahrprofilauswahl). It's mainly focused on research, reverse engineering of the FPA datasets and implementing customizations.

You can edit your datasets using the tool available on www.mqbtools.nl

## Requirements
- A MQB platform vehicle
- 3Q0907530Q and higher Gateways
- Hex-editing skills
- [010 editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/)
- A good pair of brains
- Common sense
- No fear of bricking your gateway or losing your warranty
- An inquisitive mindset
- No bad intentions.

## Usage
This repository consists of 3 parts:

### fpa_dataset.bt
This is the main template, which can parse raw binary data from a dataset in 010 editor.

### fpa_dataset_save.1sc
The 010 editor script to convert raw hex data to 0x00-shaped data.


## Wiki
The place where the entire dataset is described and explored. Check it out [here](../..//wiki).

## Contributing

Everyone can contribute to this project in some way. You can make your own dataset changes and test them, and report back. See the discussion for all topics.  If you have any suggestions or chagnes to the template or script, feel free to make a pull request.

## Disclaimer

Most of the knowledge shared on this repository was gathered, analyzed and tested by me and my friends. Several 1000's of custom datasets were made and tested. It even lead to bricked gateways in some cases. Be careful when you edit "random stuff" inside the dataset. Most of it is pretty harmless, but if there's a warning somewhere you can definitely county on it that this warning came from experiencing some crazy situation with a (partially) bricked gateway, non-functional car, etc. So don't be a douche, be careful. And don't be a super-douche: don't sell this knowledge as your own property. Don't make people pay 250 euro if you've only changed a profile button to Off-road mode, and stuff like that. In short: Be careful, be safe, be nice. Thanks!

Also: this research is strictly for fun and for the educational value. It's never my intention to harm anyone, any car or any company. As far as my limited legal knowledge goes, there's nothing illegal to this research. If you think it might break any law or can be harmful in any way to anyone, please let me know.
